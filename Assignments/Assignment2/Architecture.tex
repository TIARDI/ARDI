\section{Discussion of architecture decisions}

To create a server and a client, we implement them using the Acceptor/connector pattern along with the Reactor pattern.


First of all the connection should be as easy as possible for the client. 
By using the HTTP-protocol, the client do not need anything special to establish a connection since this is standard for all platforms.
This also means that the server must apply to the HTTP-protocol and other clients will be able to communicate with it through a given port.
\\
\\
The server will be using different patterns from the TIARDI lessons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Acceptor/Connector
	\item Wrapper Facade
	\item Reactor
\end{itemize}
The Wrapper Facade pattern can be used independently.
The Reactor can be used separately, but is easier to use if a wrapper has been applied to the functions. 
The Acceptor/Connector is very closely linked to the Reactor and will be very difficult to use without it.

Building exercise 1 was done with as much cross-platform as possible since the group's mac-user wanted to test it natively. 
Exercise 2, however, was only Windows-specific, since it only was build in Microsoft's Visual Studio.
