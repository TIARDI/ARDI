\subsection{Intro to design of server}
The server is designed to handle multiple incoming requests of different types from clients.
It accepts the following events:
\begin{itemize}
\item an alarm event, with time and priority
\item a patient value, containing a key-value pair
\item a log event containing a message
\end{itemize}
When the server starts, it listens for the events, each on a different port, and sends the program control to the reactor, who then handles incoming and current requests.
