\subsection{Intro to design of server}
The server is designed to handle multiple incoming requests of different types from clients.
It accepts the following events:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write a CPR number
\item Send back a CPR number
\end{itemize}

When the server starts, it listens for the events, each on a different port, and sends the program control to the reactor, who then handles incoming and current requests.
