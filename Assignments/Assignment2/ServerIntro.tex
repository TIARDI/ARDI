\subsection{Intro to design of server}
The server is designed to use acceptor/connector pattern, but only provides one service, that is, getting some patientvalue based on a CPR-number.
The server implements the acceptor part of the acceptor/connector pattern, that chooses what service to access, based on the what is received through the reactor pattern for exercise 4, and the leader/follower pattern in exercise 5. There is only one service to access, but through some stimuli (like differents ports) different services could be accessed.
