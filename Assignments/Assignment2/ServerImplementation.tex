\subsection{Implementation details}
To handle the asynchronous part of this assignment (i.e. the server should run multiple threads) we had the possibility of implemented either Leader/Follower, Half-synch/Half-asynch or change the Reactor to a Proactor. We choose to add the leader/follower pattern as we all had (to some extent) an idea about how it should be implemented. \\
It should be mentioned that general implementation details can be found in section \ref{sec:generalImpDetails}.
