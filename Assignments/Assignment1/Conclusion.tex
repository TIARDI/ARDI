\chapter{Conclusion}

The finished product is a PC server console application with the following applications:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Object Oriented classes for the \code{Socket} class.
	\subitem This includes rewriting them to proper \code{c++} code.
	\item It's based on the Reactor pattern.
	\item Implemented \code{SynchronousEventDemultiplexer}.
	\item The alarm event reads a priority field and a string text and shows these two along with a time stamp.
	\item The patient value read the string text and displays this.
	\item The log event read the string text and displays this.
	\item Packages sent successfully from local host and remote host.
\end{itemize}
The following has not been implemented on the server:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A stub simulating the \code{SynchronousEventDemultiplxer}. 
	\item[] This was not done, because the code is only tested with integration test of exercise 1. 
	It caused some interesting problems but they were solvable.
	This also means we have not discussed the use of it.
\end{itemize}
